A dynamic motion shot of a lamp transforming into a flamingo. The curved neck of the lamp elongates, its shade flattening into a delicate head. The camera circles as the base splits into two spindly legs, the bulb socket becoming a beak. Pink hues wash over the metal surface, transforming into soft feathers. The power cord coils and disappears as the transformation completes, revealing a graceful flamingo balancing on one leg.
