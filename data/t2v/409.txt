A dynamic motion shot of a broom morphing surreal and magically into a peacock. The handle shortens and curves into a slender neck, the bristles fanning out into a magnificent tail. The camera moves around as vibrant colors and eye-shaped patterns emerge on the expanding feathers. A small head forms at the top, complete with a delicate crest. The transformation completes as the peacock proudly displays its newly formed plumage.
