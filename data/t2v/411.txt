A dynamic motion shot of a paper airplane morphing into a swan. The pointed nose becomes a graceful neck and head, wings unfolding and expanding. The camera moves around as the flat surfaces gain volume, creases softening into feathers. The tail section splits into webbed feet. The transformation finishes as the swan's plumage turns pristine white, its beak forming from the paper's final fold.
