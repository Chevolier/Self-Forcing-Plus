A rapid tracking shot of small, big-eared gremlins on a wooden rollercoaster in a midcentury theme park. The gremlins have thin, scaly green skin with brown and black flecks. They stretch their spindly arms up and scream with wide, toothy grins as they race down a steep drop. The rollercoaster's honey-brown wooden tracks contrast with the bright, neon theme park colors. In the background, the ocean glimmers, its waves crashing against the shore, capturing the nostalgia of 1980s horror movies.
