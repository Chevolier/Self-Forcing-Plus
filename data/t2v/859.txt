Tracking shot. Cinematic scene. A 19th century scuba diver runs down a busy street in New York City. The light is natural and warm, glinting off of the diver's suit. The diver's suit is burnished and old, held together with rusted bolts. The diver's helmet is round, with a black round glass porthole in the front. All around the diver, people walk down the street in period specific attire, such as large corset dresses with sweeping skirts, tailored suits, and top hats. The scene should feel joyful and amusing, heightening the thrill of the running diver.
