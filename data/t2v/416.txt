The tiny bird's feathers begin to dissolve into misty vapor, their vibrant colors fading as they soften into translucent wisps. With each flap of its wings, the edges blur, and its body stretches into thin streaks of white. Its form rises and expands, gradually dispersing until nothing but a soft, fluffy cloud floats above, drifting lazily across the horizon, as if the bird’s essence became one with the atmosphere.
