Over the shoulder camera shot. A huge lizard creature sits in a midcentury orange swivel chair. The light is dim and volumetric, casting an eerie glow across the scene. The creature uses its arms to maniacally push buttons on a gigantic control panel. Above the control panel is a panoramic window looking out and down on 1940s new york city. The room should invoke midcentury science fiction aesthetics, like rusty orange colors, bright flashing control buttons, and space-age flair. As the creature continues to quickly push buttons, the New York City scene out of the window moves closer, as though the creature is in a gigantic robot stomping through the city. The scene should give the feeling of frantic action, highlighting the intensity of piloting a giant robot. The scene should take inspiration from midcentury japanese monster films.
