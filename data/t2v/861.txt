Camera tracking shot. An early 19th century scuba diver with a huge iron helmet and an iron body suit lounges on an antique lawn chair. The light is diffused and gray, casting soft shadows along the scene. The diver brings a martini glass to his helmet and puts it back down. The year is 1912. The diver is in a grassy tree-filled park. People in period-accurate dress mill around, wearing long dresses and suits, holding parasols. The diver's suit is burnished and old, held together with rusted bolts. The diver tips the martini toward his helmet and clinks the glass against the glass. The scene should feel serene and beautiful, evoking the feeling of an impressionist painting.
